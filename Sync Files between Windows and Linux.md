# Sync Files between Windows and Linux

## Background

We're facing one need that the application is running on one Linux (RedHat) server for report analysis, the ETL tool _Kettle_ expect to read source file uploaded to one local folder.

Instead of asking end user to upload file to Linux Server file system, our previous project had already built one Windows based web-tool (called Document Manager) to allow user download and upload files through browser, here we'd like to reuse the existing capability to make one working procedure to have file auto-sync to Linux Server.
