## Tomcat: Installing Tomcat on macOS 10.14 Mojave

Thanks Wolf Paulus @ https://wolfpaulus.com/mac/tomcat/

Pre-requisiute: Java

Since OS X 10.7 Java is not (pre-)installed anymore, need fix this first. However, opening the Terminal with following:

```
java --version
```

You should be able see like this:

```
java 11.0.1 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
```
